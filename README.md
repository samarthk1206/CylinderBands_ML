This project is part of Precision Engineering course. Below is the problem statement

The dataset intends to predict a continuous output, Humidity from the set of features and classify whether a given cylinder will experience banding ("band") or not ("no band") based on multiple process and machine attributes. Use machine learning models to classify Machine failure into two categories as per defined in “band type” feature:
Band or No Band. Also predict the Humidity based on the other features using the MLR model.

 
Following are the features and models you need to work on:

Feature 1: Humidity (MLR Model)
Feature 2: band_type (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Study the dataset properly and derive the results.
